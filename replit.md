## Overview

This is a full-stack OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management system built with React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application provides comprehensive functionality for managing organizational objectives, key results, actions, and checkpoints across different regions and service lines. It features role-based access control, real-time progress tracking, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## System Architecture

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Client makes authenticated API requests via fetch with credentials
2. Express middleware handles authentication, logging, and error handling
3. Drizzle ORM processes database queries with type safety
4. Responses are cached by React Query for optimal performance

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials to `/api/login`
2. Passport validates against database with password verification
3. Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. Client receives user data and updates auth context
5. Protected routes check authentication status

### Data Management Flow
1. User actions trigger React Query mutations
2. Optimistic updates provide immediate UI feedback
3. API requests validate data with Zod schemas
4. Database operations maintain referential integrity
5. Real-time cache invalidation ensures data consistency
